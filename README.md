# Overview

This single page application was created as a part of my Flatiron School phase 1 project completion guidelines. This application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes a fetch api from the U.S Census Bureau to analyze and compare different economic and social metrics for cities all across the United States of America. The specific API used can be found at DATAUSA.io. The link to my website can be found at https://bengcook55.github.io/Flatiron-School-SE-Phase-1-Project/

# Project Key Objectives

- Entire app must run on a single page. No redirects or reloads
- Use of at least 3 distinct event listeners of different types that enable interactivity
- At least one instance of array iteration 
- Aimed at good coding practices and utilizing DRY code 
- Blog about a technical aspect regarding phase 1: https://medium.com/@bengcook55/breaking-it-down-beginners-guide-to-apis-cb9afd60c153
